Dataset Information

This section provides details about the datasets used in our examples.

In the Neural Population Dynamics During Reach Task example, we use real monkey neural data. The first two examples in the paper use simulated data, which is automatically generated when the code is run.

For the monkey dataset example, the code uses a file named trial_748_data, which is included in this folder. An additional dataset, trial_1365_data, is also provided and can be used similarly.

You can access the full collection of trials from the following source: https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000128. If you choose to use a different trial, please update the dataset name in the code accordingly.
